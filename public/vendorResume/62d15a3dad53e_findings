1). It does not use datatable or datatable ajax for this listing, we have Yajara datatable plugin used allover the site.
2). Website column data should be visible by default, user should not need to click on it to view.
3). Date formating
4). Library links are bing called from third party server, which holds page loading speed,  it should be hosted on our server and should be called from there.(This issue is present in all pages in the site.)
5). May be we need date sorting for the records.
6). There should be default message when filter does not find any data.
7). Filter takes too long to repond, especially status and date filter.
8). There should be an option to remove filter
